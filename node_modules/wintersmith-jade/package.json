Wintersmith would usually ignore those without this plugin. With the wintersmith-jade plugin, Wintersmith will now pick up those as content and render the Jade as HTML like any other plugin.\n\nTo provide Wintersmith with metadata, use the following as a formatting example.\n\n\ttitle = 'Title'\n\tsubtitle = 'Subtitle'\n\tdate = '2013/10/12'\n\tteaser = 'Here is a sample teaser.'\n\ttemplate = 'standard.jade'\n\n\tp Content here.",
